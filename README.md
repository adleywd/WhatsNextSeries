# WhatsNextSeries
This is an multiplatform app.
WhatsNext is using a service with json requests to get tv shows and theirs 
schedules from API provided by [TheMovieDB] (https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## How to setup the TheMovieDB api key

* Duplicate the file `TheMovieDbSettings.Template.json` in the package `WhatsNextSeries.Services` and rename it to `TheMovieDbSettings.json`.


* Inside the new file `TheMovieDbSettings.json`, replace the value of the property `api_key` with your own api key.
